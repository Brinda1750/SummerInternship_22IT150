## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Creating AWS Free Tier Account
- Created an AWS Free Tier account.
- Logged on to the AWS Console.
- Explored AWS Billing and Cost Management.
- Set up a zero-dollar limit budget.
- Launched an EC2 instance from the free tier options.

### Day 2: Creating Instance with Apache Server to Deploy Web Page
- **Connected to the EC2 Instance**:
  - Connected to the instance using SSH, establishing a secure connection with the provided key pair.

- **Commands**:
  - `shell`: to write commands
  - `pwd`: current web directory
  - `whoami`: current logged-in user

- **Installed Apache Web Server on the Linux Instance**:
  - Installed Apache to serve web pages.

- **Commands**:
  - `sudo su`: elevate credentials to root
  - `yum install -y httpd`: install Apache web server (Linux server)
  - `cd /var/www/html`: navigate to the HTML directory

- **Deployed a Personal `page.html` on Apache**:
  - Deployed a simple HTML page in Apache‚Äôs root directory, making it accessible via the instance's public IP address.(http://3.26.149.37/personalpage.html)

### Day 3: Building the Portfolio
- **Setting Up the Project Structure**:
  - Created a project directory with folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets.
  - Initialized the project with a basic `index.html` file.

- **Creating the HTML Structure**:
  - Developed the portfolio structure using HTML5, including sections for the header, about me, projects, and contact information.

- **Integrating Bootstrap**:
  - Used Bootstrap for a responsive and modern design. Utilized components like navigation bars, cards, and buttons.

### Day 4: Enhancing with JavaScript, SASS, and CSS

- **Styling with SASS and CSS**:
  - Used SASS for more maintainable and modular CSS. Compiled SASS files into CSS and applied custom styles.

- **Finalizing the Deployment**:
  - Ensured all files were correctly linked and the website was functioning. Tested on different browsers and devices.

### Day 5: Configuration and Final Touch-Up
- Configured the Security Group for the Apache server to accept connections on port 80.
- Verified the configuration by accessing the personal webpage via the EC2 instance's public IP address.

- **Finalized Link**: [Personal Page](http://3.26.149.37/personalpage.html)
